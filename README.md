# Stock Price Prediction Using Neural Networks

## Overview

This project aims to develop an application that uses a neural network to predict future stock prices of companies listed in the S&P 500. While neural networks have been used for this purpose already, we believe there is potential for improvement.

## Objectives

- **Error Rate Improvement**: Our primary goal is to reduce the error rate in stock price predictions. The best standard error of regression we found in existing models is 0.787215. We aim to surpass this benchmark with our model.
- **Target Stocks**: We will focus on a selection of stocks from the S&P 500 to train our neural network and make future price predictions.

## Motivation

Accurately predicting stock price movements can provide significant advantages in financial markets. By improving upon existing neural network models, we hope to achieve more reliable predictions and contribute to advancements in this field.
